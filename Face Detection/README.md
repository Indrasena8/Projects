FACE DETECTION:
    This project is used to illustrate the detection of human's front-face using system camera are a video file.
This Project contains 4 folders showing the progress from the start to finish of the project.
The progress is as follows 
1. Opening a camera
2. Recording a video
3. Opening a recorded video
4. Drawing simple shapes on the live camera
5. Face Detection of human
Note: In order to run 3, you need to have a video of a human face recorded in prior
In order to run 5, you need to have a video of a human face recorded in prior and also the pre-trained dataset
REQUIREMENTS: 
1. Python 3 IDE or Jupyter notebook
2. Python Libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib and OpenCV
3. Pre-Trained Frontal-Face DataSet 
INSTALLATION:
